# Getting Started With This React App

## Welcome! Here is how to get started with this project so you can get it up and running as quickly as possible!

1. Git clone this whole repository into your Desktop! Simply press the green "code" button and copy the https link they provide to you. Once you are working in the Desktop directory, simply git clone <"https link">.

2. Open up the file cloned onto your desktop on your favorite code editor (mine is VS Code) and make sure you've open up the file "letsmeet" and not the parent folder "LetsMeet".

3. Run "npm install" in the terminal of your code editor or your mac terminal. Please make sure the terminal is working in "letsmeet" and not the parent folder.

4. After the installation is done, make sure to check your list of files that you now have a "node modules" and "package-lock.json" folders.

5. Now you're ready to start coding! Be sure to run "npm start" to make sure everything can be run from your computer! Goodluck =>
